## Structure

    dataset_folder:
        attribute.txt:
            n="number of nodes"
            m="number of edges"
        graph_ic.inf:
            user1 user2 influence_probability_of_user1_on_user2

## Datasets
* By order of size
* To make an undirected graph directed, we simply insure that edges go in both directions. i.e. (0)-(1) = { (0)->(1) , (1)->(0) }
